### How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?

Consider:

Send to any individual on the whole UW campus
Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values
Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through.
Your extension mechanism should allow for any kind of extension we can imagine

Without breaking functionality, there are several things to keep in mind when adding additional features to the ICDEP. With the index cards containing 4 ASCII text characters max per card, one way to add an additional feature which would also help with the issue of card duplication is including an order number with each card. This way, functionality is not lost in any way because each card is being acknowledged anyway and can therefore be counted.

One other important feature may be including sender and reciever marks on each card in order to know more specifically where to send them, or return them if they are never recieved. This feature also complements with having a note card 'message type' where: if the content is a repitive, long message, it can be sent out sporatically with index cards terminating after too high of a rotation count, since the cards are labeled as a special type of content in order to be recieved faster. This would only be necessary when the delivery is much more important to the sender than the message quality or interpretability.

Lastly, an additional change that could be made is some form of message privacy, where each person is numbered and is told to only open cards with their own number on the marked delivery section of the card. The unimportant message information can stay on the outside of the folded card, such as card number and sender/reciever address.

All of these extensions are based on the assumptions that the population is dealing with the standard 3x5 index card with 4 ASCII characters and the above explained additional markings / business rules. Furthermore, this doesn't include the possibility of accounting for malicious intent, nor the distrust/disloyalty of any of the card passers.
